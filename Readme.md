# Clothing App Styling Guide

This README provides guidelines and resources for styling the clothing app built with React Native and Expo. The design inspiration for this app is taken from the [Clothing Store App on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/178392283/Clothing-Store-AppFashion-E-Commerce-App-App-UI-Kit?tracking_source=search_projects|clothing+store+mobile+app).

## Design Inspiration

The design of the app is inspired by the Behance project mentioned above. It features a clean and modern look with vibrant colors, stylish fonts, and intuitive user interfaces. Refer to the Behance project for specific design details and inspiration.

## Styling Libraries

To achieve the desired styling, we will use the following styling libraries:

1. **React Native Styles:** Utilize React Native's built-in styling capabilities for basic styling elements like `Text`, `View`, and `Image`. For example, you can set `color`, `fontSize`, `backgroundColor`, and other style properties directly in your components.

2. **StyleSheet:** Use the `StyleSheet` module from React Native for optimizing styles by predefining them and referring to them in components. This helps improve performance by grouping styles and allowing for better reusability.

3. **React Navigation Styles:** When implementing navigation, leverage the styling options provided by React Navigation to maintain consistent styles throughout the app.

4. **Third-party Libraries:** Explore third-party styling libraries and UI toolkits compatible with React Native and Expo for additional design elements and components.

## Color Palette

The color palette for the clothing app is inspired by the Behance project:

- Primary Color: `#704F38`
- Background Color: `#EDEDED`
- Tile Color : `#1f2029`
- Body color : `#797979`

## Typography

Typography plays a crucial role in the app's design. Consider using the following fonts:

- **Primary Font:** Poppins
- **Secondary Font:** Montserrat
- **Font Size:** Maintain consistency in font sizes throughout the app for a polished look.

## Layout

- Utilize Flexbox and React Native's layout properties for responsive designs.
- Pay attention to spacing and alignment for a clean and organized layout.
- Consider using grids or columns for product listings, and maintain consistent margins and padding.

## Components

- Create reusable components for consistent styling and functionality across the app.
- Use custom styles for buttons, cards, navigation bars, and other UI elements.

## Images

- Optimize and use high-quality images for product listings and banners.
- Use appropriate image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) to balance image quality and app performance.

## Icons

- Utilize icon libraries like `@expo/vector-icons` for consistent and visually appealing icons.

## Conclusion

The styling guide provides a roadmap for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly clothing app. Feel free to explore and experiment with different styles while maintaining a cohesive and consistent design throughout the app. Enjoy the journey of bringing your clothing app to life!
